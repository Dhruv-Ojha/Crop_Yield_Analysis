# Crop Yield Analysis and Prediction

###The predictive model is built using several features, and
as such, parameters of the models are determined using historical data
during the training phase. For the testing phase, part of the historical data
that has not been used for training is used for the performance evaluation
purpose. 

Although Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and LightGBM were 
used for model evaluation, finally Extreme GRadient Boosting (XGBoost) has been
chosen for Crop prediction.
